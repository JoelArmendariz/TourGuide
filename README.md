### Technical Challenges/Research
Some unexpected challenges encountered while building this app:
- This app was built to meet a 48 hour deadline, with no prior experience in React-Native
- Importing 3rd party libraries presented a few unexpected problems regarding node-module versions
- Adding navigation through the app called for research into the anatomy of a mobile app and how to 
  implement it in React-Native



# Client Deliverables
I developed the following user stories to track deliverables and achieve the Minimum Viable Product for this app:

#### User Stories
* As a user I should be able to see a list of dates
* As a user I should be able to click on each date to see info about the coresponding event, flight, and hotel
* As a user I should be able to navigate the app intuitively and smoothly
* As a user I should be able to input new information to add new events

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP of the app displays upcoming shows, and allows the user to view all of the details necessary for a successful tour.
